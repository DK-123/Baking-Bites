# Hi! Welcome to Baking Bites, where I share a bit about my passion for baking.
I really enjoy baking and ever since quarantine started, I've had some extra time to bake things. Here are some of my most recent creations...
 
## Carrot Cake!
This cake was my first multilayered cake. Additionally, as I wanted to improve on my frosting skills, I decorated the cake to the best of my abilities. The dense cake batter from the grated carrots actually created a very rich and moist cake. Overall, the cake tasted remarkable, especially with the texture of the almonds cutting through parts of the cake in various areas as well as the addition of the cream cheese frosting.

### What did I learn?
- The trick to keep nuts afloat is to just coat them in flour to stop them from sinking to the bottom.
- I used almost 1/3 of the sugar recommended for the cream cheese frosting which actually allowed the tartness of the cream cheese to contrast with the sweetness of the cake

## Oreo Cake!
This cake was one of my more experimental cakes. I actually used 2 different recipes as reference and then created my own recipe using the experience with previous cakes. The frosting, however, was completely my original recipe. Although the cake batter seemed very liquidy before going into the oven, when it came out, the cake was very light and fluffy and combined with the frosting, it had an amazing taste.

### What did I learn?
- One of the ways to enhance the flavor of chocolate is by adding a small amount of concentrated coffee. This also helps balance the flavor of the sugar in icing if it becomes overly sweet.
- When baking with buttermilk, it is better to mix lime/lemon juice with milk and allow it to curdle rather than using yogurt.


**Why do you like baking?**
> Well I always thought that the culinary art was a very intriguing but never had quite the knack for cooking (I was more of a burner if you know what I mean). Afterwards, I tried baking and it seemed to be quite simple, with my having to do nothing more than simply following a recipe from online. And when I finnally finished, I remembered how much my hard work paid off and how rewarding it felt. And so, I've been baking ever since, always trying to make new things, experiement with new recipes, and recently adding my own flair to the delicacies all whilst trying to never repeat the same dessert twice. 
> Baking is also a very therapeutic activity which is great for destressing as well as very fun!
